# DomPDF to Snappy Migration Summary

## Migration Completed ✅

The Kabianga ARG system has been successfully migrated from `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` to `barryvdh/laravel-snappy` for PDF generation.

## What Was Removed

### Packages
- ❌ `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` - Removed via Composer
- ❌ `dompdf/dompdf` - Dependency removed
- ❌ `masterminds/html5` - Dependency removed
- ❌ `phenx/php-font-lib` - Dependency removed
- ❌ `phenx/php-svg-lib` - Dependency removed
- ❌ `sabberworm/php-css-parser` - Dependency removed

### Configuration Files
- ❌ `config/dompdf.php` - Removed

### Code Changes
- ❌ `use Barryvdh\DomPDF\Facade\Pdf;` - Removed from ProposalsController
- ❌ `printpdfsnappy()` method - Removed (duplicate functionality)
- ❌ `/api/v1/proposals/{id}/pdf-snappy` route - Removed

## What Was Updated

### ProposalsController
- ✅ `printpdf($id)` method now uses Snappy instead of DomPDF
- ✅ Simplified PDF generation code
- ✅ Maintained same route endpoint for backward compatibility

### Frontend
- ✅ Simplified PDF button (removed dual options)
- ✅ Single "Download PDF" button now uses Snappy

### Routes
- ✅ `/api/v1/proposals/{id}/pdf` - Now uses Snappy
- ✅ `/api/v1/proposals/test-snappy` - Test endpoint maintained

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Better Quality**: Snappy produces higher quality PDFs
2. **CSS Support**: Better CSS rendering and support
3. **Performance**: Generally faster for complex documents
4. **Font Handling**: Superior font rendering
5. **JavaScript**: Can execute JavaScript before PDF generation

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Same API endpoint (`/api/v1/proposals/{id}/pdf`)
- ✅ Same response format
- ✅ Same filename generation
- ✅ Same error handling structure

## Testing

The migration maintains full backward compatibility. Existing code that calls the PDF endpoint will continue to work without changes, but now benefits from Snappy's superior rendering.

### Test Endpoints
```bash
# Test PDF generation
GET /api/v1/proposals/{id}/pdf

# Test Snappy functionality
GET /api/v1/proposals/test-snappy
```

## Files Modified

1. `composer.json` - Removed DomPDF, kept Snappy
2. `app/Http/Controllers/Proposals/ProposalsController.php` - Updated imports and methods
3. `routes/api.php` - Cleaned up duplicate routes
4. `resources/views/pages/proposals/show.blade.php` - Simplified UI
5. `config/dompdf.php` - Removed file
6. Documentation files - Updated

## Migration Complete

The system now exclusively uses Snappy for PDF generation, providing better quality output while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing integrations.
