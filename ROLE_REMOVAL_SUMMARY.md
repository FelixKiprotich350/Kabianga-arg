## Current System Architecture

### Permission System
- Users now have permissions assigned directly through the `userpermissions` table
- No role-based permission inheritance
- Admin users (`isadmin = true`) bypass all permission checks

### Access Control
- `isadmin` property: Super admin access (bypasses all checks)
- Direct permissions: Specific permissions assigned to individual users
- Permission checks use `haspermission($shortname)` method

### User Management
- Users can be set as admin or regular user
- Users can be active or inactive
- Permissions are assigned individually to each user
- No role hierarchy or role-based permissions

## Migration Notes
- The `role` column has been completely removed from the `users` table
- All role-based logic has been replaced with permission-based logic
- The `UserRole` model and related functionality for dynamic roles remains intact for timeline management
- The system now relies solely on `isadmin` flag and direct permission assignments
